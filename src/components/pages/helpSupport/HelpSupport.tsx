          Welcome to our Help & Support center! Here you&#39;ll find answers to
          common questions about account access, payments, and course issues. If
          you&#39;re having trouble logging in or resetting your password, our
          step-by-step guide can help. You can also manage your subscriptions,
          update billing details, or request a refund easily through your
          profile. If a course isn&#39;t loading properly or your progress
          isn&#39;t saving, we&#39;re here to fix it fast. For anything else,
          feel free to reach out to our support team via email or live chat â€” we
          typically respond within 24 hours. Our support hours are Monday to
          Friday, from 9 AM to 6 PM (GMT+6). We&#39;re here to make sure your
          experience is smooth and stress-free.
